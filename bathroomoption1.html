                <p>You quickly yet quietly hide yourself in the bathtub. The footsteps get louder before stopping at what sounds like the room you woke up in. You hear nothing for a bit, but then they begin towards you, and stop at the bathroom door. The door opens, and your heart rate violently picks up. When they flick the lights on, you realize just how stupid of a hiding spot you picked. They open the curtains, and before you can beg or scream, your head is freed from your shoulders.</p>
