                <p>You head inside of the closest door on the left. It's a simple bathroom, though very cramped. You take this time to deal with that terrible thirst issue, though the water tastes terrible. You begin to start to clean the wound on your leg. It hurts, but it'll be worth it when all of a sudden.. you hear thumping footsteps approaching, and you aren't gonna just stick out in the open. you quickly flick the lights off... but what now??</p>
