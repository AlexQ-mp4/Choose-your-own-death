                <p>After a couple of minutes, your vision starts to clear, and you prepare to get up. Just then, the clamps on the chair activate, holding you down. You then realize, this is no regular uncomfortable metal chair. Panic sets in as you hear mechanisms whir to life, and slots open below the chair. You start to feel a sharp pain below you, as active sawblades are slowly raising into your body. You are never found, but you <i>are</i> in four nice evenly cut pieces.</p>
