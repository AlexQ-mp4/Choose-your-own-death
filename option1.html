                <p>You stumble out of the chair, sweaty, knees weak, and arms feeling heavy, you quickly vomit, and fall onto the floor. You feel terrible, and lie on the ground for a minute. You snap back to reality upon hearing mechanisms whir to life. You look over at the chair, and watch sawblades within it rise. Good thing you got off when you did.</p>
                
                <p>You glance around the room, there isn't really much of anything. Where are you? What is this place? You'll figure this out later, for now, you need to get out of here. You attempt to stand again but quickly realize the disgusting gash in your left leg. Now isn't the time to complain, you limp your way to the door.</p>

                <p>You enter a dimmly lit hallway. All you can hear is your own staggered breathing. There are two doors to your left, and one door to your right. There's more hallway to the right, but there's no light, and you don't know what could be lurking within.... </p>
