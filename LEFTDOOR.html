                <p>You open the left door, and it leads outside! You move as quickly as your leg will allow you to through the path in the woods. You keep going, desperately trying to ignore the pain in your leg. You keep seeing blood everywhere. On the trees, on the rocks, on the closed beartraps... You aren't the first to take this path.. are you? You come to a crossroads. It's either the path to go up... or the path to go down... what now?</p>
