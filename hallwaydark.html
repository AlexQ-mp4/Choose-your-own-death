                <p>As you cautiously move through the dark hallway, your senses sharpen. The darkness feels heavy around you, making it hard to see. You reach out, feeling the rough walls for guidance. Every little sound makes you jump, wondering if danger is nearby. Your heart races, and you take slow steps, hoping to find your way out. With determination, you continue forward, trying not to let fear take over. All you can think about is escaping the unknown danger waiting in the shadows. </p>
